# generativePieces
First of all, big thanks to Danny: here is his [Codepen](https://codepen.io/DanDan) and the [pen](https://codepen.io/DanDan/pen/ALylw) I got this from.

### Why did I create this?
> We want to see how others interpret the clothing and what their creative vision is.
This was a mail i've received from the Rezareez team. They wanted me and other creatives 
to create something we found fitting of the Rezareez brand and clothing style.

I thought something that generates a new piece would be a dope thing to do.

### What did I add or change?
* The links that change color on every reload.
* The canvas painting as wide as the screen allows (the painting will be shorter if you're on mobile, and longer if you're on desktop).
* The main colors that are used in the pieces (I've added the colors that I saw were repeated a lot within the shoot).

I randomized the :
* Size
* maxRad
* minRad
* Amount of circles
* Amount of iterations.
